            "**Infections (Most Common):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Viral Infections:** The vast majority of sore throats are caused by viruses.\n",
            "    *   **Common Cold:**  Often accompanied by other symptoms like runny nose, cough, congestion, and sneezing.\n",
            "    *   **Flu (Influenza):**  More severe than a cold, with symptoms like fever, body aches, fatigue, and headache.\n",
            "    *   **Mononucleosis (Mono or \"Kissing Disease\"):** Can cause a very severe sore throat, along with fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and sometimes an enlarged spleen.\n",
            "    *   **COVID-19:** A viral infection with a wide range of symptoms, including sore throat.\n",
            "    *   **Other Viruses:**  Measles, chickenpox, croup, and herpes simplex virus can also cause sore throats.\n",

            "*   **Bacterial Infections:** Less common than viral infections, but often more severe.\n",
            "    *   **Strep Throat:** Caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacteria.  Symptoms include a sudden, severe sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, red and swollen tonsils (often with white patches), and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Strep throat requires antibiotic treatment to prevent complications like rheumatic fever.\n",
            "    *   **Tonsillitis:** An infection of the tonsils, which can be caused by bacteria or viruses.\n",
            "    *   **Whooping Cough (Pertussis):**  A highly contagious respiratory infection characterized by severe coughing fits, but can also start with cold-like symptoms including a sore throat.\n",

            "    *   **Dry Air:** Dry air, especially during winter, can dry out and irritate the throat.\n",

            "    *   **Alcohol and Certain Foods:** Can be irritating to the throat in some people.\n",
            "*   **Muscle Strain:**  Yelling, talking loudly for an extended period, or straining your voice can cause a sore throat.\n",
            "*   **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Stomach acid backing up into the esophagus can irritate the throat (laryngopharyngeal reflux).\n",
            "*   **Tumors:**  Rarely, a sore throat can be a symptom of a tumor in the throat, tongue, or larynx. This is more likely if the sore throat is persistent and doesn't go away with treatment.\n",
            "*   **HIV Infection:** A sore throat can be an early symptom of HIV infection.\n",
            "*   **Certain Medications:** Some medications can cause a sore throat as a side effect.\n",

            "\n",
            "**The Key Point: Headaches Don't Come From the Brain Itself**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   The brain tissue itself doesn't have pain receptors. So, the feeling of a headache comes from the structures *surrounding* the brain, including:\n",
            "    *   Blood vessels in the brain, scalp, and neck\n",
            "    *   Muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders\n",
            "    *   Nerves in the head and neck\n",

            "**What Triggers the Pain?**\n",
            "\n",
            "Headaches are often triggered by a combination of factors that activate or irritate these pain-sensitive structures. These factors can be broadly categorized:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Changes in Blood Vessels:**\n",
            "    *   **Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels):** This can stretch the vessel walls, stimulating pain receptors. This is thought to play a role in some migraine headaches.\n",
            "    *   **Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels):** Followed by rebound vasodilation.\n",
            "    *   **Inflammation of blood vessels:** As seen in conditions like temporal arteritis.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Muscle Tension:**\n",
            "    *   **Tightening of muscles in the scalp, neck, and shoulders:**  Prolonged tension (from stress, bad posture, or clenching your jaw) can lead to tension-type headaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Nerve Irritation or Dysfunction:**\n",
            "    *   **Activation of the trigeminal nerve:** This is a major nerve in the face and head, and its activation is strongly implicated in migraines and cluster headaches.\n",
            "    *   **Nerve compression:** Problems in the neck can sometimes compress nerves leading to headaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Chemical Imbalances:**\n",
            "    *   **Changes in neurotransmitters:** Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine play a role in pain processing. Imbalances can trigger headaches, especially migraines.\n",
            "    *   **Hormonal fluctuations:**  Changes in estrogen levels, particularly in women, can be linked to headaches.\n",
            "    *   **Certain foods and drinks:**  Some substances (like caffeine, alcohol, aged cheeses, processed meats) are known headache triggers for susceptible individuals.\n",
            "\n",

            "*   **Migraines:**  More complex and intense than tension headaches.  Likely involve a combination of blood vessel changes, nerve activation (particularly the trigeminal nerve), and chemical imbalances in the brain.  Often have specific triggers like certain foods, stress, or hormonal changes.\n",
            "*   **Cluster Headaches:**  Severe, intensely painful headaches that occur in clusters (periods of frequent attacks followed by periods of remission).  The exact cause isn't fully understood, but they are thought to involve the hypothalamus (a region in the brain that regulates body functions) and the trigeminal nerve.\n",
            "*   **Sinus Headaches:**  Caused by inflammation and pressure in the sinuses, often associated with a sinus infection.\n",
            "*   **Rebound Headaches (Medication-Overuse Headaches):**  Caused by the overuse of pain medication to treat headaches.  The body becomes dependent on the medication, and headaches occur when the medication is withdrawn.\n",
            "*   **Secondary Headaches:**  Headaches that are symptoms of an underlying medical condition, such as:\n",
            "    *   High blood pressure\n",
            "    *   Infections (like meningitis or encephalitis)\n",

            "*   Sudden, severe headache (especially if it's the worst headache you've ever had)\n",
            "*   Headache with fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking\n",
            "*   Headache after a head injury\n",
